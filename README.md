# 🫐 🐍 snake-game

This is my version of the classic **Snake Game**.

This game was created using the [Turtle Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) 🐢 and [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) 🐍.

This is a single player game. 🕴

The snake is in motion when the game begins.

You move the snake by using the keyboard:
- Use the ⬆️ key to move up.
- Use the ⬇️ key to move down.
- Use the ⬅️ key to move left.
- Use the ➡️ key to move right.

Food randomly appears on the screen. 🫐

You must move the snake so that the snake's head touches the food. 🫐 🐍

When the snake eats, you get a point. 🏆

But when the snake eats, **the snake's body grows longer**. 🤯

The snake cannot touch the "walls" or its own body. If it does, **you lose!** 💥

**The longer you play, the more challenging the game becomes!**
